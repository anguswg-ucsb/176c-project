---

# The hidden need for ungrouping

- `ungroup()` should always be  applied after the grouping calcuations.. 
- If you forget to `ungroup()` data, future data management will likely produce errors.
-  Even if you do not plan on performing additional calculations, it’s a good habit to keep. 
- `ungroup()` is especially important when creating objects!!

--

- Think about the dimision of your data structure!

# Data Visualization
---
# ggplot

- `ggplot2` is a library is based on the **grammar of graphics**

--

- the idea is you can build every graph from the same
few components: 
  1. a data set 
  2. geom(s)
  3. a coordinate system

--

- `ggplot2` provides a programmatic interface for specifying
 - what variables to plot, 
 - how they are displayed, 
 - general visual properties. 
 
--

- Therefore, we only need _minimal_ changes if the underlying data changes or if we decide to change our visual.

- This helps create publication quality plots with minimal amounts of adjustments and tweaking.

--

- ggplot likes data in the ‘long’ format: i.e., a column for every dimension, and a row for every observation. (more on this tommorrow!!)

---

# Components of a ggplot:

- ggplot graphics are built step by step by adding new elements and layers

--

  1. Data
  2. Geometry (geom)
  3. Aesthetic mapping
  4. Theme

--

- Elements of a plot are layered by iteritavly adding elements 

--

- These can be added in a series of 5 steps:

1. Setup
2. Layers
3. Labels
4. Facets
5. Themes

---

# Example Data for today ...

```{r}
(gm2007 = filter(gapminder, year == 2007))
```

---

# 1. The Setup: canvas

.pull-left[
An empty canvas can be initialized with `ggplot()`
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot()
```
]

---

# 1. The Setup: data

.pull-left[
- Every ggplot requires a data argument (data.frame/tibble)
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(data = gm2007)
```
]

---

# 1. The Setup: Aesthetic Mappings

.pull-left[
- Aesthetic mappings describe how variables in the `data` are visualized

- Denoted by the `aes` argument  

- Aesthetic mappings can be set in ggplot() and/or in individual layers.

- Aesthetic mappings in the ggplot() call, can be seen by all geom layers. 

- The X and Y axis of the plot as well colors, sizes, shapes, fills are all aesthetic. 

- If you want to have an aesthetic fixed (that is **not** vary based on a variable) you need to specify it _outside_ the aes()
]

.pull-right[

```{r}
ggplot(data = gm2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
```
]

---

# 2. Layers

- The `+` sign is used to add layers to a `ggplot` setup

--

- Layers can define geometries, compute summary statistics, define what scales to use, or even change styles. 

--

- In general a plot construction will look like this:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
DATA %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  LAYER 1 + 
  LAYER 2 + 
  … 
```

---

# 2. Layers: Geometry

- Many layers in `ggplot2` are called ‘geoms’. 

--

- `geoms` are the geometric objects (points, lines, bars, etc.) that can be placed on a graph to visualize the `X-Y mapping` of the input `data`

--

- They are called using functions that start with `geom_*`. 

--

- Examples include:
  - points (`geom_point`, for scatter plots, dot plots, etc)
  - lines (`geom_line`, for time series, trend lines, etc)
  - boxplots (`geom_boxplot`)
  - … and many more!
  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ls(pattern = '^geom_', env = as.environment('package:ggplot2'))
```
  
  
---

# 2. Layers: Geometry

- A plot **must** have at least one geom, but there is no maximum.

--

- Adding geoms to a ggplot follows the pattern:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>, aes(X, Y)) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

- Note again that the aesthetics placed in the `ggplot` call are the **global** parameters for the plot, and the aethetics placed in each `geom` are specific to that `geom`.

---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("geom1", title = "# A first geom_* ...", width = c(60,40,0))`

```{r geom1, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gm2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---

# 2. Layers: Geometry

.pull-left[
Like the set up, `geoms` can be modified with aesthetics (`aes`). Examples include:

- position (i.e., on the x and y axes)
- color (“outside” color)
- fill (“inside” color)
- shape
- line type
- size

Each `geom` accepts only a **subset** of these aesthetics

(refer to the `geom` help pages (e.g. `?geom_point`) to see what mappings each `geom` accepts. 
]

.pull-right[
<img src="lec-img/06-geom-point.png" width="75%">
]

---
# 2. Layers: data.frame driven or fixed?

.pull-left[
```{r}
ggplot(data = gm2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(col = "red")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(data = gm2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(col = continent))
```
]

---
`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("geoms", title = "# For our example...", width = c(50, 50, 0))`

```{r geoms, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gm2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_smooth(color = "black") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(gm2007$lifeExp), color = "gray") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(gm2007$gdpPercap), color = "gray") 
```
---

# 3. Labels

- Now that you have drawn the main parts of the graph. You might want to add labs that clarify what is being shown. 

--

- This can be done using the `labs` layer. 

--

- The most typical are: `title`, `x`, and `y` but other options exist!

---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("labs", title = "# For our example...", width = c(50,50,0))`

```{r, labs, include = F}
ggplot(data = gm2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_smooth(color = "black", size = .5) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(gm2007$lifeExp), color = "gray") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(gm2007$gdpPercap), color = "gray") + 
  labs(title = "Per capita GDP versus life expectency in 2007",
       x = "Per Capita GDP", 
       y = "Life Expectancy", 
       caption = "Based on Hans Rosling Plots",
       subtitle = 'Data Source: Gapminder',
       color = "", 
       size = "Population")
```
---
# 4. Facets

- In the previous chart, we showed a scatterplot for all countries plotted in the same chart. What if you want one chart for each continent?

--

- Such separation is called `faceting`

--

- `facet_wrap()` takes in a formula as the argument. 

- Formulas look like this `RHS ~ LHS` (where RHS = right hand side, LHS = left hand side)

The item on the RHS corresponds to the column. The item on the LHS defines the rows.

--

- In `facet_wrap`, the scales of the X and Y axis are fixed to accommodate **all** points by default. 

- This makes the comparison of values more meaningful because they would be in the same scale.

- The scales can be made `free` by setting the argument `scales=free`.

---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("facet", title = "# Facet Wrap...")`
```{r, facet, include  = FALSE}
ggplot(data = gm2007, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  geom_smooth(color = "black", size = .5) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(gm2007$lifeExp), color = "gray") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(gm2007$gdpPercap), color = "gray") + 
  labs(title = "Per capita GDP versus life expectency in 2007",
       x = "Per Capita GDP", 
       y = "Life Expectancy", 
       caption = "Based on Hans Rosling Plots",
       subtitle = 'Data Source: Gapminder',
       color = "", 
       size = "Population") + 
  facet_wrap(~continent) + 
  facet_wrap(~continent, scales = "free")
```
---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("grid", title = "#Facet Grids...")`
```{r, grid, include = FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1952, 1977, 2007)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = pop)) + 
  labs(title = "Per capita GDP versus life expectency in 2007",
       x = "Per Capita GDP", 
       y = "Life Expectancy", 
       caption = "Based on Hans Rosling Plots",
       subtitle = 'Data Source: Gapminder',
       color = "", 
       size = "Population") + 
  facet_wrap(year~continent) +
  facet_grid(year~continent) +
  facet_grid(continent~year)
```

# 5. Theme

- Great! Now we just need to polish our plots...

--

- ggplot offers a themeing system:

--

1.  `elements` specify the non-data elements that you can control. For example, 
  -  `plot.title` controls the appearance of the plot title; 
  - ` axis.ticks.x` controls the ticks on the x axis; 
  - `legend.key.height`, controls the height of the keys in the legend.

--

2. Each `element` is associated with an element function, which describes the visual properties. For example, 
  - `element_text()` sets the font size, color and face of text elements like `plot.title`.

-- 

3. The `theme()` function which allows you to override  default elements:
   - For example  `theme(plot.title = element_text(color = "red"))`.

---

# Built in themes

Wow! Thats a lot :) Fortunately, ggplot comes with many default themes that set all of the theme elements to values designed to work together harmoniously.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ls(pattern = '^theme_', env = as.environment('package:ggplot2'))
```

---

# theme_bw()

```{r}
theme_bw
```

---

`r flipbookr::chunk_reveal("theme", title = "#Built in Themes...")`

```{r, theme, include = FALSE}
gm2007 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent, size = pop)) + 
  labs(title = "Per capita GDP versus life expectency in 2007",
       x = "Per Capita GDP", 
       y = "Life Expectancy", 
       caption = "Based on Hans Rosling Plots",
       subtitle = 'Data Source: Gapminder',
       color = "", 
       size = "Population") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme_dark() + 
  theme_gray() +

```

# Saving a ggplot element...

 - Remember that in R, we assign object to names. We have seen examples including values, data structures, and functions:

--
```{r}
x = 10 
class(x)
```

--

 - ggplot outputs are also objects!

```{r}
gg = ggplot()
class(gg)

lobstr::obj_addr(gg)
```

---
# ggsave()

- ggplot comes with a function ggsave, that write a gg object to a file path (with path, name, extension)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggsave(gg, file = "img/my-beatuiful-plot.png")

# or #

gg %>% 
  ggsave(file = "img/my-beatuiful-plot.png", 
         width = 8, 
         units = c("in"))
```

---

# Assignment

In your `geog176A-daily-exercises`
1. Make a new `R` directory (mkdir R from the parent directory)
2. Create a new R file called day-06.R (touch R/day-06.R)
3. Open that file. 
  - This is an R script. Unlike Rmarkdown it will not knit, but unlike the console, it will save and keep your code. 
4. In this file add your name, date, and the purpose of the script as comments (preceded by #)
5. Now, read in the COVID-19 data from the URL like yesterday

***

---


**Question 1**: Make a _faceted_ line plot (*geom_line*) of the **6** states with **most** cases. Your X axis should be the _date_ and the y axis _cases_.

We can break this task into 4 steps:

 1. Identify the six states with the most current cases (yesterdays assignment + `pull`)
 2. Filter the raw data to those 6 states (hint: `%in%`)
 3. Set up a ggplot --> add layers --> add labels --> add a facet --> add a theme
 4. save the image to you `img` directory (hint: `ggsave()`)

***

<img src="lec-img/06-question-01.png" width = "35%">
</center>
---

**Question 2**: Make a column plot (`geom_col`) of daily total cases in the **USA**. Your X axis should be the _date_ and the y axis _cases_.
 
We can break this task into 3 steps:

 1. Identify the total cases each day in the whole country (hint: `group_by(date)`)
 2. Set up a ggplot --> add layers --> add labels --> add a theme
 3. Save the image to your `img` directory (hint: `ggsave()`)
